```

### Run Development Server

npm run dev
```

## Building

npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Deployment

This demo is deployed to [gravyjs.com](https://gravyjs.com) using AWS S3 and CloudFront.

**Note:** The Google Analytics ID from your `.env` file will be included in the production build during deployment.

### Deployment

#### From gravyjs-demo directory:

```bash
npm run setup    # One-time infrastructure setup
npm run deploy   # Build and deploy to S3/CloudFront
```

#### From gravyprompts.com root:

```bash
npm run demo:setup    # One-time infrastructure setup
npm run demo:deploy   # Build and deploy to S3/CloudFront
```

The setup command creates the S3 bucket and configures it for static hosting.
The deploy command builds the app, syncs to S3, and invalidates CloudFront cache.
